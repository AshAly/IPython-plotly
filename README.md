IPython-plotly: Interactive Graphs
======

Use Plotly's scientific graphing libraries and Ipython to make and share interactive, publication-quality graphs
in your web browser. That means you can interface Plotly's online graphing tools with IPython, easily sending or streaming data to your Notebook, and making interactive, shareable graphs in IPython. 

And Plotly also makes it easy to post and share your data and graphs, together, publicly with a url or privately with your team.

Examples 
--------

You can also use Plotly and IPython to make interactive graphs.
