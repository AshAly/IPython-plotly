    "\n",
    "In financial analysis, the famous [Black--Scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) prices an option as a function of six variables: Underlying Price, Interest Rate, Dividends, Strike Price, Time-to-Expiration, and Volatility. For a given option contract, we can observe the Underlying Price, Interest Rate, and Dividend Rate. In addition, the options contract specifies the Strike Price and Time-to-Expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one variable we have to tweak is thus the volatility. Let us ask the question: What Volatility is such that the Black--Scholes equation price equals the market price?\n",

    "$$\n",
    "F(\\text{Volatility}^*) = \\text{Market Option Price},\n",

    "where $\\text{Volatility}^*$ is the volatility **implied** by the market price or the [implied volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_volatility). $F$ is a continuous function on $[0, 1]$ so we can use a root finder to get value(s) of $\\text{Volatility}^*$ which solve(s) the above equation."

    "We can use a few different NAG functions; [nag_zero_cont_func_brent](http://www.nag.com/numeric/CL/nagdoc_cl23/html/C05/c05ayc.html) finds the root using Brent's Algorithm, [nag_bsm_price](http://www.nag.com/numeric/CL/nagdoc_cl23/html/S/s30aac.html) calculates the theoretical option price, [nag_2d_cheb_fit_lines](http://www.nag.com/numeric/CL/nagdoc_cl23/html/E02/e02cac.html) performs a least squares Chebyshev fit to the volatility surface, and [nag_2d_cheb_eval](http://www.nag.com/numeric/CL/nagdoc_cl23/html/E02/e02cbc.html) evaluates the surface at intermediate points."

    "We will use the popular packages Python offers for numerical computing and data analysis: `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pandas`. The latter has fast and efficient data analysis tools to store and process large amounts of data. In addition, `pandas` comes with `numpy` and `ctypes` built into it, which allows easy integration with NAG's `nag4py` package. Visualizations will be made with `plotly`."
